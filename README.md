The to-do list


1. gathering data
  * measure DHS
  * other sources
  * generate list
  * collect information on antimalarials
    * Placebos vs. genuine trial info
    * Drug-taking regimen, contraindications
    * Find out what "any" and "other" comprise

focus on Tanzania
Arusha, Mwanza = comparable cities (in size)
Dodoma = capital, where raid happened

Did they stop using drugs bc they couldn't trust?
Did they use them more now that the counterfeits were gone?


2. geocoding households and busts
3. mapping tasks
4. statistical tests of changes
